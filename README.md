A live search bar to find movies using The Movie Database(TMDB)'s API.

### Getting started
To get started make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and then from the project root run:
```

```

Make sure you have an API key and configure your key (see API keys section for details).

Once all dependencies are installed run:
```
$ npm start
```
A new window should automatically open in your browser. If not, go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

### API keys
If you don't have a TMDB API key, make sure you get one by creating an account at [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and follow the instructions at [https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) to get your API key.

Then, follow the instructions in `config.example.js` in the root directory to configure your API key.
